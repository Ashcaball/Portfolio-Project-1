## Portfolio-Project-1

The biggest disruptor to all of our lives since 2020 has been the Covid- 19 pandemic. It is now 2022, the world is back to 'normal', and I want to be a data analyst so I decided to look into the impacts of covid, vaccinations, and the unfortunate effects of the virus. In the repository you'll find my thought process and SQL code as I examine this data.
